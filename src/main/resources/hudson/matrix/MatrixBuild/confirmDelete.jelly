 Modification of https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/hudson/model/Run/confirmDelete.jelly

 We copy this template in order to use it.deleteMessage instead of it.whyKeepLog as displayed message.
 This is required in order to have a warning which does not prevent the actual deletion.
